      <p>The Academic Commons is home to digital materials related to Willamette University's academic mission.
        The Academic Commons offers a reliable and permanent way for this information to be found, used and cited.</p>

      <p>Formally recognized academic units of the university such as departments, centers, institutes and programs
        are encouraged to establish Academic Commons collections. </p>
      <!--  <h3>Examples</h3>
        <p>Examples of content that may become part of the Academic Commons include: </p>
        <ol>
          <li><a href="/commons/info/collection.html#faculty">Faculty research publications</a> </li>
          <li><a href="/commons/info/collection.html#student">Student research</a> </li>
          <li> Non-published research materials, such as images, datasets, maps and GIS files</li>
          <li> Journals, reports, newsletters, and other university publications of academic interest </li>
          <li>Documents, images and media files related to the history of the university</li>
          <li>Digital recordings of lectures or performances </li>
        </ol>
        <p>See the <a href="/commons/info/collection.html">Academic Commons Collection Policy</a> for more information. </p>     -->

      <h3>Two Collection Types</h3>
      <p>The Academic Commons supports two collection types: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>University Collections</strong> are actively curated by the library, archives and museum, sometimes in collaboration with other Willamette University faculty and staff. These collections are of broad interest and require complex collection management techniques. </li>
        <li><strong>Community Collections</strong> are maintained by departments and individuals within the Willamette community. These collections are focused primarily on the resources and needs of each department or project.  General University polices for retention and intellectual property apply to these collections. </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Publishing</h3>
      <p>The easy way to publish existing digital documents, images, datasets and other completed work is to request a Community Collection.  With your own Community Collection, you can
        use the Academic Commons to share your content with a wide audience. </p>
      <p>Working with you, the Academic Commons staff can also assist with creating and publishing new digital works and collections.  Using the Library's Digital Production Lab,
        we can create digital copies, full-text document transcriptions and metadata. Results can be published online using tools developed for the Academic Commons.</p>

      <h3>Digital Preservation</h3>
      <p>Files in the Academic Commons will be managed and preserved for the long term. Files will be protected from decay on disk and when possible migrated to  file formats needed by future generations. See our <a href="/commons/info/preservation.html">Preservation Policy</a>.</p>


      <!--
<h3>Other Highlights</h3>
<p>Academic Commons content can be accessed through other Willamette University websites and services.  Both the <a href="http://library.willamette.edu/archives/">Willamette University Archives</a> and the <a href="http://www.willamette.edu/arts/hfma/index.html">Hallie Ford Museum of Art</a> use the Commons to manage and provide access to their digital collections.</p>
<p> Some Commons image collections can be accessed directly within the Pachyderm 2.0 authoring tool.  The Hallie Ford Museum and Willamette University students have used this capability to create and publish multimedia presentations.</p>
<p>Currently, the Hallie Ford Museum's collection highlights web pages are created by linking the Academic Commons with WebEdit, the Willamette University content management system.</p>
      -->
      <h3>What the Academic Commons is Not</h3>
      <p>The Academic Commons is designed for materials of academic or historical value that require long-term access and preservation. It cannot be used to manage or distribute digital files for short term personal research, classroom use or group projects. </p>


      <h3>More Information</h3>
      <p>For more information about the Academic Commons, or to inquire about creating an Academic Commons collection for your department or project, contact the <a href="/commons/info/contact.html">Academic Commons Staff</a>. </p>
