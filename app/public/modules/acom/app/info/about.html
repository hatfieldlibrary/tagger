      <h1>About the Academic Commons</h1>

      <p>The Academic Commons provides is a access point to the many online collections, exhibits, student performances, and research projects produced at Willamette University.
        The Academic Commons is also the publishing service used by many of these online projects.
        By offering a reliable and permanent way for digital publications and data to be found, accessed and cited, the Academic Commons enhances the value of faculty and student research and university publications.</p>
      <p> The Academic Commons can play a role in meeting the data management requirements of grant awards.</p>
      <p>Formally recognized academic units of the university such as departments, centers, institutes and programs are encouraged to establish Academic Commons collections. </p>
      <h5>Examples</h5>
      <p>Examples of content that may become part of the Academic Commons include: </p>
      <ol>
        <li><a href="collection.php#faculty">Faculty research publications</a> </li>
        <li><a href="collection.php#student">Student research</a> </li>
        <li> Non-published research materials, such as images, datasets, maps and GIS files</li>
        <li> Journals, reports, newsletters, and other university publications of academic interest </li>
        <li>Documents, images and media files related to the history of the university</li>
        <li>Digital recordings of lectures or performances </li>
      </ol>
      <p>See the <a href="collection.php">Academic Commons Collection Policy</a> for more information. </p>
      <h5>Two Collection Types</h5>
      <p>The Academic Commons supports two collection types: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>University Collections</strong> are actively curated by the library, archives and museum, sometimes in collaboration with other Willamette University faculty and staff. These collections are of broad interest and require complex collection management techniques. </li>
        <li><strong>Departmental Collections</strong> are maintained by departments and individuals within the Willamette community. Although University policies apply to these collections, they are built primarily around the needs and resources of each department or project. </li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Ownership</h5>
      <p>Copyright ownership is typically retained by the author or creator. The copyright owner must grant the University a non-exclusive right to distribute and preserve any material submitted to the Academic Commons. For more information, see the <a href="copyright.php">Academic Commons Copyright Policy</a>. </p>
      <h5>Other Highlights</h5>
      <p>Academic Commons content can be accessed through other Willamette University websites and services.  Both the <a href="http://library.willamette.edu/archives/">Willamette University Archives</a> and the <a href="http://www.willamette.edu/arts/hfma/index.html">Hallie Ford Museum of Art</a> use the Commons to manage and provide access to their digital collections.</p>
      <p> Some Commons image collections can be accessed directly within the Pachyderm 2.0 authoring tool.  The Hallie Ford Museum and Willamette University students have used this capability to create and publish multimedia presentations.</p>
      <p>Currently, the Hallie Ford Museum's collection highlights web pages are created by linking the Academic Commons with WebEdit, the Willamette University content management system.</p>
      <h5>What the Academic Commons is not</h5>
      <p>The Academic Commons is designed for materials of general academic or historical interest that require long-term access and preservation. It cannot be used to manage or distribute digital files for short term personal research, classroom use or group projects. </p>
