            <p>The purpose of the Academic Commons is to collect and preserve academic and creative works in digital formats and to share this content widely.</p>
            <p> It is built with a set of tools that can be used to create online collections, multimedia exhibits, digitized manuscripts and books and to make these available for research and teaching.</p>

      <h2>How the Academic Commons Can Help</h2>
      <p>There are several ways that Willamette faculty, students and staff use the Commons.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The simplest use of the Academic Commons is to share your existing online project with us. If it meets our criteria, we will add it to the Academic Commons website.</li>
        <li>Most departments need a permanent home for digital content.  The Academic Commons can provide that as well.  Read how to <a href="/commons/info/start">Start a Collection</a>.</li>
        <li>The expertise and tools behind the Academic Commons can be used to create distinctive digital collections or digitize single artifacts.  For example, we work closely with the University
          Archives to create online collections like the 175-year run of the <a href="/commons/collec/16">Willamette Collegian</a> and with the Hallie Ford Museum of Art.</li>
        <li>We continuously support and develop tools for creating online, interpretive exhibits. Recent examples include the <a href="/commons/collec/66">Myra Wiggins Exhibit</a>, a touch screen
          exhibit designed to accompany an exhibit at the Hallie Ford Musuem of Art.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><a href="/commons/info/staff">Contact us</a> to discuss needs or project ideas.</p>
