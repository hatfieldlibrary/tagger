      <h1>About the Academic Commons</h1>
      <p>The Academic Commons is a public catalog of  academic and creative work at Willamette University.  In addition, it provides a set of tools that
        can be used to create online collections, exhibits, digitized manuscripts and books and to make these available for research and teaching. </p>
      <p>The Academic Commons and the <a href="/commons/info/dpl">Digital Production Lab</a> are supported by staff from the Hatfield Library Systems Division who have expertise in data management, web
        development, repository software and application design. </p>



      <h2>How the Academic Commons Can Help</h2>
      <p>The purpose of the Academic Commons is to continuously improve and preserve Willamette University's
        academic online presence and to share this presence widely. To that end:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The simplest use of the Academic Commons is to share your existing online project with us. If it meets our criteria, we will add it to the Academic Commons website.</li>
        <li>Most departments need a permanent home for digital content.  The Academic Commons can provide that as well.  Read how to <a href="/commons/info/start">Start a Collection</a>.</li>
        <li>The expertise and tools behind the Academic Commons can be used to create distinctive digital collections or digitize single artifacts.  For example, we work closely with the University
          Archives to create online collections like the 175-year run of the <a href="/commons/collec/16">Willamette Collegian</a> or the <a href="/commons/collec/3">Campus Photograph Collection</a>.</li>
        <li>We continuously support and develop tools for creating online, interpretive exhibits. Recent examples include the <a href="/commons/collec/66">Myra Wiggins Exhibit</a>, a touch screen
          exhibit designed to accompany an exhibit at the Hallie Ford Musuem of Art.</li>
      </ul>
       <p><a href="/commons/info/staff">Contact us</a> to discuss needs or project ideas.</p>
      <h5>Examples</h5>
      <p>Examples of content that may become part of the Academic Commons include: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Faculty research publications </li>
        <li>Student theses and research projects</li>
        <li> Non-published research materials, such as images, datasets, maps and GIS files</li>
        <li> Journals, reports, newsletters, and other university publications of academic interest </li>
        <li>Documents, images and media files related to the history of the university</li>
        <li>Digital recordings of lectures or performances </li>
      </ol>

      <h5>Two Collection Types</h5>
      <p>The Academic Commons supports two collection types: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>University Collections</strong> are actively curated by the library, archives and museum, sometimes in collaboration with other Willamette University faculty and staff. These collections are of broad interest and require complex collection management techniques. </li>
        <li><strong>Departmental Collections</strong> are maintained by departments and individuals within the Willamette community. Although University policies apply to these collections, they are built primarily around the needs and resources of each department or project. </li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Ownership</h5>
      <p>Copyright ownership is typically retained by the author or creator. The copyright owner must grant the University a non-exclusive right to distribute and preserve any material submitted to the Academic Commons. For more information, see the <a href="copyright.php">Academic Commons Copyright Policy</a>. </p>
      <h5>Other Highlights</h5>
      <p>Academic Commons content can be accessed through other Willamette University websites and services.  Both the <a href="http://library.willamette.edu/archives/">Willamette University Archives</a> and the <a href="http://www.willamette.edu/arts/hfma/index.html">Hallie Ford Museum of Art</a> use the Commons to manage and provide access to their digital collections.</p>
      <p> Some Commons image collections can be accessed directly within the Pachyderm 2.0 authoring tool.  The Hallie Ford Museum and Willamette University students have used this capability to create and publish multimedia presentations.</p>
      <p>Currently, the Hallie Ford Museum's collection highlights web pages are created by linking the Academic Commons with WebEdit, the Willamette University content management system.</p>
      <h5>What the Academic Commons is not</h5>
      <p>The Academic Commons is designed for materials of general academic or historical interest that require long-term access and preservation. It cannot be used to manage or distribute digital files for short term personal research, classroom use or group projects. </p>
      <h5>More Information</h5>
      <p>For more information about the Academic Commons, or to inquire about creating an Academic Commons collection for your department or project, contact the <a href="contact.php">Academic Commons Staff</a>.  See also a summary of <a href="technology.php">Technology</a> used in creating the Academic Commons. </p>

      <p> The Academic Commons can play a role in meeting the data management requirements of grant awards.</p>
      <p>Formally recognized academic units of the university such as departments, centers, institutes and programs are encouraged to establish Academic Commons collections. </p>
