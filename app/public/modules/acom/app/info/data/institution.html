      <h1>Institutional Resources</h1>
      <p> The Mark O. Hatfield Library and Willamette Integrated Technology

        Services offer resources and services to help manage your digital data.&nbsp; The following

        may be cited entirely or in part in NSF or other grant proposals.<br>
      </p>
      <h3>Data repository services</h3>
      <p> The Willamette University Academic Commons can be used to publish,

        manage, and preserve data.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Academic Commons uses <a href="http://www.dspace.org/">DSpace</a>,
        a stable, widely adopted platform for building open digital

        repositories. The Academic Commons DSpace service provides

        enhanced access controls and persistent

        URLs to data your.&nbsp;&nbsp; Access restrictions and embargo periods can

        be applied as requested by the researcher. Data can be easily

        downloaded by authorized users or members of the public.&nbsp;&nbsp; DSpace records are indexed by Internet search

        engines and readily discoverable. (See:

        http://libmedia.willamette.edu/xmlui/community-list)

        In addition to DSpace, an alternative digital asset management system is

        available and may be preferred in some cases.<br>
      </p>
      <h3>Data collection and metadata</h3>
      <p> Although data and collection  metadata required for NSF-funded projects will vary

        by project and discipline, general-purpose metadata can be useful whenever publishing

        and sharing data to a wider audience.  The Willamette University DSpace repository  supports Dublin

        Core (DCMI).  Dublin Core is a widely-adopted, general purpose standard for sharing information about items and collections.&nbsp; When special metadata

        requirements exist (as may be the case for GIS data, for example) separate metadata files can be added to a DSpace record.</p>
      <p> Willamette University library staff will assist researchers in shaping

        their data collection procedures and in creating the Dublin Core

        metadata template appropriate for their data needs.&nbsp; Descriptive

        metadata be can be added during the DSpace submission process as well

        as subsequently edited and amended by the researcher.&nbsp;

        Administrative metadata will be automatically created during the DSpace

        submission process, including time stamps, file size, and file

        checksums.&nbsp; Additional administrative information can be provided

        by the researcher, such as the techniques and tools used to create the

        data, and added to the appropriate Dublin Core field in

        the item record.</p>
      <p> The DSpace repository service accepts data in vitually any format.</p>
      <h3>Preservation of data</h3>
      <p> The Willamette University DSpace service supports selected file formats

        for long-term access.&nbsp;&nbsp; The list of supported formats is subject to

        revision.&nbsp; For more information, see the Academic Commons

        <a href="/commons/info/preservation">Preservation Policy.</a></p><p>
      File checksums are routinely run for all files in the DSpace

      repository.&nbsp; As required, files will be refreshed by Hatfield

      Library and Willamette Integrated Technology Services staff.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Data Storage and Backup</h3>
      <p> Willamette University supports several approaches to data storage and backup.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Data temporarily stored on Willamette University's storage area network

          (SAN) via a mapped network drive. This data is automatically backed up

          to magnetic tape and retained for a 3-month period at an off-site

          storage facility. Networked storage is a limited resource, and transfer

          of large volumes of data can be slow.</li>
        <li> Data deposited in the Academic Commons. This data resides on Willamette

          University's storage area network (SAN). The University's data

          management strategy includes automated backup to magnetic tape of data

          in the Academic Commons repositories. This is a permanent backup of all

          files. The backup tapes are subsequently moved to an off-site storage

          facility.</li>
        <li> University staff an also advise and assist researcher who use external

          storage media connected to a PC or other device.<br>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Retention of data</h3>
      <p>The Willamette University DSpace service is designed for long term

        preservation of and access to content.&nbsp; Occasions will arise,

        however, when content needs to be removed at the request of the author

        or the discretion of the University. Reasons for removal include grant

        or publisher requirements, author revisions, factual inaccuracy,

        copyright infringement, cost of storage, or changes in collection

        policies. The typical withdrawal procedure will be to remove the item

        from view. To avoid loss of the historical record the withdrawal

        transaction will be traced in the form of a note in the

        &lt;Description.provenance&gt; field of the DSpace record.<br>
