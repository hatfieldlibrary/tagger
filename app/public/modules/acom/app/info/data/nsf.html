      <h1>National Science Foundation</h1>
      <p>All NSF proposals with a due date of

        January 15, 2011 or later must include a <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf11001/gpg_2.jsp#dmp" target=_new>Data Management Plan</a>, no longer than two pages, that describes the PI&#8217;s plans for managing data and sharing
        the products of research, or shows that such plans are not needed.</p>
      <p>Your Data Management Plan should describe how the project
        will conform to NSF policy on disseminating and sharing research results, including:<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> the
          types of data, samples, physical collections, software, curriculum
          materials, and other materials that will be produced during the project</li>
        <li > the
          standards that will be used for the format and content of data and
          metadata (if existing standards are absent or deemed inadequate,
          document the situation and propose solutions or remedies) </li>
        <li > policies
          for access and sharing, including provisions for appropriate protection
          of privacy, confidentiality, security, intellectual property, or other
          rights or requirements </li>
        <li > policies
          and provisions for re-using and re-distributing data, and for producing
          derivatives </li>
        <li>plans
          for archiving data, samples, and other research products and for
          preserving access to them</li>
      </ul>
      <p >If there&#8217;s room, include a statement of institutional
        procedures and capabilities for data storage and maintenance. Your plan
        is the most important information; if it fills the two pages, you can put the
        institutional information in the Project Description, as part of the
        Intellectual Merit or Broader Impacts. See <a href="commons/info/data/institution">Willamette University data management services</a> for relevant information.</p>
      <p >Data Management Plans
        will be submitted through <a href="https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/index.jsp" target=_new>Fastlane</a> as
        a supplementary documents; Fastlane will not accept proposals that lack
        Data Management Plans. Data Management Plans will be reviewed as part of the
        intellectual merit or broader impacts of the proposal, or both, as
        appropriate.</p>

      <h3>Creating a Data Management Plan</h3>
      <p> Topics to cover in a written plan include the following.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><p>Description of the project: purpose of the research, organizations and staff involved.</p></li>
        <li><p>Description of data to be collected,  method of collection, its nature and format.</p>
          <div class="panel">
          <p>As you consider this topic, you may find it helpful to consult this <a href="http://libraries.mit.edu/guides/subjects/data-management/evaluate.html" target=_new> set of questions</a> from MIT.
            The type and quantity of data produced, the audience, the frequency of changes or updates and the
            length of time data will be retained all affect your data plan -- and the degree to which University or external data services might contribute to the project.</p>

        <li><p>name of the persons responsible for data management, during your research

        <li><p>explanation
          of how data will be documented throughout the research project</p>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Good documentation (also known as metadata) makes data more useful over the longhaul.
              It's important to start documenting at the beginning of the research project and continue throughout.
              These <a href="http://libraries.mit.edu/guides/subjects/data-management/metadata.html" target=_new>general-purpose guidelines for documentation and metadata</a> are available from MIT. Willamette University library staff can offer additional information to those interested in using the Academic Commons service and DSpace.</p>

        <li><p>description
          of your short-term and long-term storage plans, including backup procedures</p>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Short-term storage and backup can be managed by an individual or team.  Long-term storage, over a period of years or decades,
              is a more difficult problem that usually requires  support from the university or other organization.</p>
            <p>For a quick overview, see <a href="commons/info/data/storage">Storage and Backup</a> considerations.</p>
            <p>Note that ideally, three backup copies of data are maintained: the original, a second external copy located on campus, and a third copy off-site. Willamette University options include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li style="font-size: 12px;"> External storage media connected to a PC or other device.  This is often a good solution for short-term storage and backup. Willamette University staff can advise and support researchers who use this option. </li>
              <li style="font-size: 12px;">Data  stored on Willamette University's storage area network (SAN) via  mapped network drive (typically your <a href="http://www.willamette.edu/wits/help/home/" target=_new>home directory</a> or H drive).
                This data is automatically backed up to magnetic tape and retained for a 3-month period at an off-site storage facility. <i>Networked storage
                  is a limited resource.</i> </li>
              <li style="font-size: 12px;">Data deposited in the Academic Commons.  This data resides on Willamette University's storage area network (SAN).
                Backup tapes are subsequently moved to an off-site storage facility. The University's data management strategy includes permanent backup of all data in the Academic Commons.</p>  </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Beyond the university, a <a href="commons/info/data/repositories">subject-specific repository</a> or journal publisher Web site may be a good long-term storage strategy for some  data.</p>

          how you will make the data available for public use and potential secondary uses&nbsp;-&nbsp;</p>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>The Internet provides a variety of formal and ad hoc ways to make data available, including posting online via a project or institutional web site, submitting data to a journal publisher, or depositing data in a subject-specific data repository or local institutional repository.</p>
            <p>See this list of <a href="commons/info/data/repositories">subject-specific data repositories</a>.</p>
            <p> Locally, the Academic Commons DSpace repository is a good way to publish, manage, and preserve research data. <a href="http://www.dspace.org/" target=_new>DSpace</a> is a widely adopted platform for building open digital repositories at colleges and universities.  The Willamette University  service provides file access
              controls and a third-party, persistent URL service for citing and linking to data.   Access restrictions and embargo periods for data can be applied
              as requested by the researcher and data files easily downloaded by either authorized users or the public.   DSpace records are indexed by Internet
              search engines and are readily discoverable. </p>
            <p> In addition to DSpace, an alternate digital asset management system is available through the Mark O. Hatfield Library and may be preferred in some cases. </p>

        <li><p>explanation of your plans to preserve the data and ensure a long-lived format</p>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Changing file formats is a key consideration in preserving data.  Certain formats are more likely to survive the test of time or be more easily migrated to new formats when the need arises. </p>
            <p>See these <a href="http://libraries.mit.edu/guides/subjects/data-management/formats.html" target=_new>general guidelines for file formats</a> from MIT.</p>
            <p>Locally, the Academic Commons DSpace service supports long-term access to selected file formats.   Most  "supported"  formats are standards-based, non-proprietary and uncompressed. As such, these formats are more easily migrated to  new file formats of the future.   The Academic Commons <a href="commons/info/preservation"> list of supported formats</a> is subject to revision.</p>

            <p>In addition,
              checksums for detecting corrupted data are routinely run for all files in the Academic Commons DSpace repository.  Files will be refreshed by Hatfield Library and Willamette Integrated Technology Services staff as required.        </p>

          <div class="panel">
            <p><b>Data security:</b> There are <a href="commons/info/data/security">several factors to consider</a> in keeping data secure.
              Whenever data is accessible via the Internet or the Willamette University local area network,
              password access controls are a minimal security requirement.
              Access to files in the Academic Commons can be password restricted to the PI, the project team, or opened to the public.
              Non-authorized users can contact the individual designated in the DSpace record to request access to the data.</p>
            <p><b>Intellectual property:</b> Data is not copyrightable.  But data licensed or otherwise obtained from third-parties may be subject to use restrictions.  To make your own data explicitly available for sharing and unlimited use by others, you may wish to attach a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/">Creative Commons CC0</a> waiver.  When using the Academic Commons, intellectual property information can be added to the permanent record for your data.</p>
            <p><b>Confidentiality and ethical considerations:</b> For more information about legal and ethical considerations for research involving human and non-human animal participants, consult the <a href="http://www.willamette.edu/dept/irb/index.html">Willamette Institutional Review Board</a> guidelines.  When obtaining informed consent from research subjects, be sure to tell participants about how data will be stored and used and how confidentiality will be maintained. </p>
