      <h1>Starting a Collection</h1>
      <p>You can start a collection in two ways.</p>
      <h4>1. Propose a Project</h4>
      <p>The Academic Commons supports various research and publishing projects by faculty, students and academic units such as the University Archives and Hallie Ford Museum of Art.
        The Library's Digital Production Lab is managed by Academic Commons staff and provides resources for many of these projects.</p>
      <p>Once production work is complete, the Academic Commons offers ways to present the work online.</p>
      <p>To learn more about whether the Academic Commons can benefit your scholarly project, please feel free to <a href="/commons/info/contact.html">contact one of our staff</a>.</p>
      <h4>2. Request a Community Collection</h4>
      <p>Community Collections can be requested by any unit of Willamette University that: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Produces content related to the University's academic mission;</li>
        <li>Is a permanent department or organization;</li>
        <li>Has a point person who assumes responsibility for collections.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The <a href="contact.html">Academic Commons Coordinator</a> will meet with the department or its designated collection coordinator to discuss: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The purpose of the collection </li>
        <li>The intended audience </li>
        <li>Intellectual property issues </li>
        <li>The types of materials or publications (published or unpublished articles, images, datasets) </li>
        <li>File formats (PDF, JPEG, TIFF) </li>
        <li>Disk space requirements </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once the review is complete, the Academic Commons Coordinator, a liaison librarian, or other staff will then work with the department to create a collection that meets its requirements. </p>
