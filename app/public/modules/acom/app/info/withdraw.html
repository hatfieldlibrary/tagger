      <p>Files will occasionally need to be removed from the Academic Commons at the request of the author or at the discretion of the University. Reasons for removal include  revisions by the author, factual inaccuracy, copyright infringement, cost of storage or changes in collection policies.</p>
      <p>In the case of faculty or student research papgers, which may be cited, a "tombstone" record will be supplied in place of the withdrawn record. The tombstone record will include the original metadata (for verification) and a withdrawal statement. The item metadata should be visible to anyone following the citation link, but not searchable. Tombstone records will be not be available to Internet search engines.</p>
