      <h1>Intellectual Property</h1>
      <p>The Willamette University <a href="http://www.willamette.edu/dept/policies/ip/">Intellectual Rights and Property Policy</a> describes the ownership of and usage rights for intellectual property created by community members.
        The following additional provisions apply to content submitted to the Academic Commons.</p>
      <h3>Community Collections</h3>
      <p>An author who submits work to the Academic Commons grants the non-exclusive right to publish
        this content through the Academic Commons site. </p>
      <p>Unless other University policies apply to the material, the author or collection owner
        is free to decide who has access to this content and how long that content remains in the repository. He or she can request that access be restricted, or that the item be withdrawn. The University
        Library may also limit access or choose to withdraw the work at any time.</p>
      <h3>University Collections</h3>

        The items in these collections are permanent additions to the Academic Commons and the University will retain a perpetual, non-exclusive right to distribute the work.
        Before undertaking a collection or publishing project,  Academic Commons staff will work with the content
        owner to reach a simple, fair and mutually beneficial licensing arrangement that is consistent with University policy.</p>

      <p>Use of copyrighted images in Academic Commons collections must be consistent with the guidelines established by the <a href="http://www.vraweb.org/">Visual Resources Association</a> (VRA).
