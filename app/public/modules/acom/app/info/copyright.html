      <p>The Willamette University <a href="http://www.willamette.edu/dept/policies/ip/">Intellectual Rights and Property Policy</a> describes the ownership of and usage rights for intellectual property created by community members.
        The following additional provisions apply to content submitted to the Academic Commons.</p>
      <h3>Community Collections</h3>
      <p>An author who submits work to the Academic Commons grants the non-exclusive right to publish
        this content through the Academic Commons site. </p>
      <p>When not governed by other University policies regarding retention or intellectual property, the author or collection owner
        is free to decide who has access to their content and how long that content remains in the repository. He or she can request access limits or withdrawal. The University
        Library may also limit access or choose to withdraw the work at any time.</p>
      <h3>University Collections</h3>
      <p>
        University Collections are those that have been professionally produced, curated, or enhanced using University Library staff or other University resources.
        The items in these collections are permanent additions to the Academic Commons and the University will retain a perpetual, non-exclusive right to distribute the work.
        Before undertaking a collection or publishing project,  Academic Commons staff will work with the content
        owner to reach a simple, fair and mutually beneficial licensing arrangement that is consistent with University policy.</p>

      <h3>Copyrighted Images</h3>
      <p>Use of copyrighted images in Academic Commons collections must be consistent with the guidelines established by the <a href="http://www.vraweb.org/">Visual Resources Association</a> (VRA).  The limited distribution of copyrighted images in a manner consistent with these guidelines is considered to be fair use.</p>
