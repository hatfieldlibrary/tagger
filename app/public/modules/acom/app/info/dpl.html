       <p class="teaser">The Digital Production Lab  provides services geared toward academic projects.</p>
      <p>The Digital Production Lab (DPL) is managed by the Hatfield Library Systems Division and provides students with employment opportunities that utilize technology
        in academic projects.  Past projects include:
        <ul>
      <li> Digitizing historical image collections from the University Archives.</li>
      <li> Automated text transcription of WU yearbooks.</li>
      <li> Developing online access for the 175-year run of the <i>Willamette Collegian.</i></li>
      <li> Creating item descriptions and conducting background research.</li>
      <li> Producing a touch screen kiosk exhibit for an exhibit at the Hallie Ford Museum.</li>
      </ul>

          <p>DPL projects are not required to live within the space of the Academic Commons. Many projects do, and the DPL staff and students
          provide much of the innovation and quality work make the Academic Commons more successful over time.</p>
          <p>However, the mission of the DPL is to serve the entire campus.  We have the ability to participate in
            a variety of academic projects, particularly in the digital humanities. </p>
          <p>Please contact us if you want to discuss an idea for a project or grant proposal.  Because our staff is small,
          we prioritize projects that help us build capacity that can be used by others.  </p>

              <p>Katie Brownley, a student intern at Willamette Universityâ€™s Digital Production Lab in the Mark O. Hatfield Library,
                has been working with digitized scans of old manuscripts, in this case a school yearbook from 1935. Archaic fonts and
                cursive are a challenge to contemporary software that transcribes scanned texts. Brownley compares the scans to the transcriptions
                that will run online alongside and fixes the mistakes. (Photo: ASHLEY SMITH / STATESMAN JOURNAL)</p>
