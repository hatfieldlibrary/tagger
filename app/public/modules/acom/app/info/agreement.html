        <p class="teaser">In order for Willamette University to reproduce and distribute your submission, you agree to the following terms. </p>
        <p>
        <ol>
          <li> Grant of Permission. I am a student at Willamette University (WU), and
            I hereby give to WU my permission to include my senior thesis (Work) in
            the WU institutional repository for access by future Willamette University
            students and faculty.  At the University's discretion, to better serve the
            scholarly community my senior thesis may also be included in a public access
            collection.</br></br></li>
          <li>Certification of Authorship. I am the owner of the copyright to
            the Work, and the Work is not now subject to any grant or
            restriction that would prevent its use consistent with this
            permission. Except as explicitly indicated on the Work, all
            aspects of the Work are original to me and have not been copied or
            adapted from other sources.</br></br></li>
          <li>Privacy Release. I hereby authorize and consent to the release,
            maintenance and display of my name, status as a student at WU, and
            any other personal information I have provided in connection with
            the Work and its use by WU. This authorization also includes the
            disclosure of the content of the Work itself and any associated
            information. I hereby release The Trustees of Willamette
            University, its member trustees, officers, employees and agents,
            and any other person who may be legally liable, from any and all
            claims, demands, causes of action, and suits, including but not
            limited to claims for invasion of privacy, defamation, breach of
            contract or other breach of duty, arising out of or in connection
            with the maintenance, use or release of any personal information
            as described above.</li>
